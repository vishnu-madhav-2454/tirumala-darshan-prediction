## Temple Legend (Lord Venkateswara)
================================================================================

Temple Legend

Bharat, the land of spiritual bliss is strongly believed to be pervaded by the Lords, their deep imprints and a sense of divine presence, eternally available in the environment around.

The presence of deities is often felt in the structures called temples, which are the epitomes of the great, age old, rich Hindu Sanatana Dharma.
Among the galaxy of temples, which are also the architectural marvels located in our country, the hill shrine of Tirumala is accredited as being the most visited temple in India and also in the world as a whole.
Located on the picturesque Seshachalam Hill Ranges, this temple occupies a unique place in our great land of holy shrines.

The “Temple Legend” is made out of references from a range of ancient scriptures such as Varaha Purana, Padma Purana,
Garuda Purana, Brahmanda Purana, Markandeya Purana, Harivamsa Purana, Vamana Purana, Brahma Purana, Brahmottara Purana,
Aditya Purana, Skanda Purana and Bhavishyottara Purana.These extracts describe the sanctity and antiquity of the deity,
temple and the hills around Tirumala, besides the numerous teerthams, streams and springs that abound them.

The legends taken from the Venkatachala Mahatmya and the Varaha Purana, pertaining to the manifestation of the Lord at Tirumala,
are of particular interest.

According to the Varaha Purana, Adi Varaha manifested himself on the western bank of the Swami Pushkarini (temple tank),
while Vishnu in the form of Venkateswara came in to reside on the southern bank of the Swami Pushkarini.

During the eight thousand yugas (the time equivalent to a day and night for Brahma, the Creator),
there was a raging fire, and everything on Earth was reduced to ashes. Man had to forsake the Earth and seek refuge in Janaloka.

At the approach of night (for Brahma), Vayu, the Wind God, blew furiously. Huge clouds were formed, there was a torrential rain,
which resulted in Pralaya Kalpa (the Great Deluge). The Earth sank into the Patala loka, and remained in that state for a
thousand years (during a part of that night of Brahma).

Sri Maha Vishnu, who decided to save Mother Earth, assumed the form of Adi Varaha, a giant wild boar and proceeded to Patala loka.
He fought a fierce duel with the demon king Hiranyaksha and killed him. He then splashed the water and brought the Earth up by
carrying it on his huge tusks.

Brahma, the Devas and the sages extolled Adi Varaha's virtues, by chanting the Vedic mantras. They prayed to him to re-establish the Earth as before.
Adi Varaha obliged them, and called upon Brahma to recreate the Universe. He expressed his desire to reside on the Earth to protect its people.
He commanded his vehicle, Garuda to fetch Kridachala (a massive natural hill with lofty peaks, embedded with gold and precious stones resembling Adisesha in shape)
from Vaikuntam.

Garuda brought Kridachala and placed it on a sacred spot, the East of Swami Pushkarini, chosen by Adi Varaha himself.
Adi Varaha stood within the divine vimana of Kridachala, which glittered with many splendorous gem-studded gopuras.

Brahma and the other holy personages requested the fearsome-looking Adi Varaha to assume a tranquil and composed look,
and rest on the hill to protect the mankind and grant boons to people unable to reach God through Dhyana Yoga (meditation)
and Karma Yoga (doing one's own duty).

Adi Varaha with his consort Bhudevi appeared with four arms and a blissful countenance, adorning an array of jewels.
He took a divine decision to stay at Venkatadri, under a divya vimana, to answer the prayers of the devotees.

During the Dwaparayuga, Vayudeva (the Wind God) went to Vaikuntam to pay his obeisance to Lord Sri Vishnu.
The Lord was reclining in the company of Maha Lakshmi and the doorway was guarded by Adisesha.
Vayudeva was incensed when Adisesha prevented him from entering Sri Vishnu’s holy abode resulting in a fierce battle between them.

When Lord Vishnu intervened, each was boasting of his superior valour and supreme might.
To test who was stronger, the Lord suggested that Adisesha should encircle the Ananda hill, an off-shoot of the Meru Mountain
on its northern side, while Vayudeva should blow hard to dislodge the Ananda hill from Adisesha's strangle hold.
The contest waxed furiously, and as the World trembled, Brahma, Indra and the other deities prevailed upon Adisesha to yield
victory to Vayudeva for the welfare of the world, as a whole.

Obliging them, Adisesha released his hold on the hill, with the result, Adisesha and the Ananda hill were together blown away to
the banks of the river Swarnamukhi. As Adisesha was crestfallen over his defeat, Lord Brahma and the others appeased him by saying
that he would be integrated with the hill Venkatadri and would become the abode of Lord Vishnu. Adisesha then metamorphosed into
the vast Seshadri hill range, while his hood manifested itself into Venkatadri, the abode of Lord Sri Venkateswara, his trunk
portion turned out to be Ahobila supporting Lord Narasimha and his tail housing Srisailam bearing Lord Mallikarjuna (Lord Siva).

At the commencement of the Kali Yuga, Lord Vishnu left Venkatadri for Sri Vaikuntam, his divine abode.
Lord Brahma was saddened over the Lord’s departure and asked Narada to persuade Vishnu to return to Venkatadri.
Narada then went to the banks of the River Ganga, where several rishis were performing a holy sacrifice.
The rishis could not decide as to whom they should dedicate the fruit of their yaga. Bhrigu, one of the rishis
took the task upon himself for testing who among the three chief divinities-Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva,
is the supreme Lord to receive the divine boon of the Yaga.

Sage Brigu first went to Satyalokam, the abode of the three-headed Lord Brahma the creator.
Brahma was found busy chanting the Vedas with one face, uttering the name of Narayana with
another and looking at Goddess Saraswati with the third. He took no notice of Bhrigu’s arrival.
Bhrigu resented by the lack of courtesy from Brahma, left Satyalokam in a huff.

Bhrigu then proceeded to Siva's abode (Kailasam) as a part of his holy mission.
Here too, he found Lord Siva absorbed in sporting with his consort Parvathi Devi taking no notice of his visit.
Lord Siva also became indignant at Bhrigu’s intrusion into his privacy which further enraged the sage.

Finally, Bhrigu went to Sri Vaikuntam, the abode of Lord Vishnu and found Vishnu and Sri Maha Lakshmi reclining on Adisesha unmindful of his arrival.
Disgusted over this, Bhrigu, known for his intemperate nature, kicked Lord Vishnu on the chest, where Sri Maha Lakshmi was reclining.
Vishnu immediately got up, massaged rishi's foot and enquired if his foot was injured when he kicked on his hard chest.
Taken aback over Vishnu’s attention and cool composure, Bhrigu returned to the rishis and advised them to dedicate the fruit of their sacrifice to Vishnu,
as he deserved it best, among the divine Trinity.

But, Sri Maha Lakshmi was furious over Bhrigu for kicking the holy spot and her favourite abode - the bosom of the Lord. She left Vishnu in a fury and
went on to stay at Karavirapura (now Kolhapur in the state of Maharashtra) to commence a deep penance. Unable to bear the solitude after Sri Maha Lakshmi’s
departure, Vishnu left Vaikuntam in search of her and wandered across the forests and hills.

Frustrated over not finding his consort anywhere, Lord Vishnu took an ant-hill on Venkatadri under a tamarind tree as a dwelling place, besides a Pushkarini.
Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva, taking pity at the plight of Lord Vishnu, made up their mind to serve him in the guise of a cow and calf. Surya – the Sun God,
informed Lakshmi of this and requested her to sell the cow and calf to the king of the Chola country assuming the form of a cattle care-taker.
The Chola king sent the cow and its calf to graze on the Venkata Hill along with his herd of other cattle. Discovering Lord Vishnu in the ant-hill,
the holy cow everyday emptied her udder in

## Temple History
================================================================================

Temple History

Lord Sri Venkateswara, also known as Srinivasa, Balaji, and Veṅkaṭachalapati, made Tirumala his abode five thousand years ago.
Even before him, it was Lord Varahaswami who had made Tirumala his abode. Since then, many devotees have continued to construct grand
entrances on the ramparts of the temple over generations. The temple complex is spread over 16.2 acres of land.

In Tirumala, the East facing Sri Varahaswami temple is located in the North West corner of the temple tank - Swami Pushkarini.
As per the temple legend, Lord Srinivasa sought a gift of land from Sri Varahaswami, which he readily granted.

In return, Srinivasa provided him with an agreement deed assuring that he would be paid the first darshan,
worship and offerings by all the devotees visiting the temple. This tradition is in practise to this day at Tirumala
and Lord Varahaswami continues to receive the age old traditional worship. Even today, all offerings are first made to
Lord Varahaswami and then to Lord Sri Venkateswara.

The height of the main entrance has been increased periodically since 13th century. Its present height is fifty feet.
This entrance has other names such as ‘Padivaakili’ and ‘Simhadwaram’.In Tamil it is called ‘Periya Thiruvasal’.
On either side of this main entrance there are two feet high statues made of alloy metal (Pancha loha).
They are Sankanidhi and Padmanidhi who are the guardians of ‘Navanidhi’, the treasure of Lord Sri Venkateswara.

The Maha Dwaram comprises three consecutive entrances – the first is a brass one,
while the second is a silver one. The third entrance is a golden one.

These are the two angels guarding the wealth and treasure of Lord Sri Venkateswara.
As per the tradition these are installed at the third entrance of the temple.
One enters the holy shrine after saluting the first protection threshold - Sankha Nidhi and Padma Nidhi.
According to history, these statues were consecrated by Vijayanagara emperor Achyutha Rayalu, the younger brother of Sri Krishna Deva Rayalu.

Abutting the Mahadwara and to its right, there is a high-rise mandapam (Porch).
This is called Krishnadevarayalu Mandapam or Pratima Mandapam.
This mandapam has been constructed in Vijayanagara architectural style. To the right side of this porch, one can find tall
copper statues of the emperor of Vijayanagara kingdom, Sri Krishnadevarayalu and his two consorts, Tirumala Devi and Chinnadevi.

These three statues placed in front of Lord Sri Venkateswara express their devotion to him.
It is said that Sri Krishnadevarayalu himself installed these statues on 2nd January 1517 A.D.
and then onwards this mandapam has become famous as the Krishnadevarayalu mandapam.
Their names are inscribed on the shoulder badges of these statues.

By the left side of the main entrance or Mahadwaram there is a tall copper statue with folded hands.
This is the statue of Venkatapatirayalu, the king of Chandragiri. He was a generous king who ruled Chandragiri during 1570s and donated
many valuable gifts to the deity.

Twelve feet to the north of Sri Krishnadevarayalu Mandapam, there is a glass porch.
Every day at 2 p.m., a service called”Dolotsavam” is performed for the Lord in this glass porch.
Historical evidence proves that this seva programme began to be performed in 1831.

Just opposite to the glass porch, there is another high rise mandapam called Ranganayakula Mandapam.
Due to the Muslim invasions between 1320 and 1369 A.D., the idols of Lord Ranganadha of Srirangapatnam were shifted
to Tirumala for safe keeping. Daily prayers and poojas were offered to him in this Mandapam.
After the cessation of the Muslim invasions, these statues were once again shifted back to Srirangam.
Yet this place has retained the name of Ranganayakula Mandapam to this day.

This mandapam is said to have been built by the king of Tirupathi, named Ranganadha Yadava Rayalu.
It is in this mandapam that Kalyanothsavams were performed for the Lord.
However, due to the increase in pilgrim rush, currently daily Kalyanothsavams are performed in Sampangi Pradakshinam.

Ten feet to the south of the flagstaff, there is another stone pillared pavilion called Tirumalaraya Mandapam.
This was built by Saluvanarasimharayalu, the emperor of Vijayanagara, to express his gratitude to the Lord for the help extended towards his victories.

All couples begetting children with the blessings of the Lord, offer money in the form of coins, silver, candy and camphor equivalent to the weight of their children, as avowed by them.
Even the patients, who are cured of their diseases, express their gratitude similarly. This Tulabharam is arranged in front of the Ranganayakalu Mandapam.

At about hundred feet from the flagstaff, there are three copper statues of devotees, facing the Lord and saluting him with folded hands.
One is that of Lala khemaramu, the other is that of his mother Mata Mohana Devi and the third one is that of his wife Pita Bibi.
Lala Khemarumu is a kshatriya known as Raja Todaramallu. He courageously protected Tirumala both from the invasions of Muslims and the British during the seventeenth century.
The Lord blessed this family and bestowed them with a place in His temple.

Dwajasthambham, -the golden flagstaff is located in the middle of a twenty-pillared square pavilion.
To the east of the flagstaff there is an altar and to the northeast, there is granite stone called ‘Kshetrapalakasila’.
This pavilion is said to have been constructed in the fifteenth century.

During Brahmotsavams, a flag with Garuda’s imprint is hoisted on this flagstaff for extending an invitation to gods and goddesses (Yaksha, Kinnera and Gandharva), to attend this festival.
Those wishing to take pooja material or other things into the sanctum, have to perform circumambulation along dwajasthamba including the Lord whenever he is taken outside or returned to the main temple.

Adjoining the flagstaff is the Bali Peetam or altar. After offering Naivedyam to the Lord and other deities and after exiting through the silver gate, the Prasadam is kept on this altar.
It is believed that this food offering is accepted by deities, the angles and the elemental forces.

To the north east corner of the altar, under the flagstaff porch, there is a one and half feet high stone slab. This is called ‘Kshetrapalaka Sila’.
It is said that this stone slab marched around the temple for providing security to the Shrine at night.

Priests used to keep the keys of the temple on this stone slab every night after closing the temple and collect them to open the temple in the morning, after saluting it.

On entering the precincts of the temple, one first encounters the circumambulation passage called ‘Sampangi Pradakshinam’. The grand circumambulation passage outside the temple is not considered for this purpose. Therefore ‘Sampangi Pradakshinam’ is considered to be the primary one.
Earlier Sampangi flower plants (gold flowers, Michelia Champaka) were grown in this pathway for decorating the Lord and hence, the name.

Four pavilions in the four corners of ‘Sampangi Pradakshinam’ were built by Saluva Narasimha Raya in 1470 A.D. in the names of himself, his wife and his two sons.

Earlier all wedding festivities of the Lord were celebrated at the pavilion in the ‘Vimana Pradakshinam’.
With the increase in the number of the devotees attending the events, these festivities started being held for some time in Ranganayaka Mandapam.
Now, the celestial wedding is performed in this Kalyanotsava Mandapam.

‘Ugranam’ means Godown. All the pavilions on western side are now being used as store houses.
The material used for the Lord’s ‘Puja’ and other rituals is now stored in the North-West corner of the ‘Sampangi Pradakshina’.

As per the legend, Viraja, a sacred river of Vaikuntam flows below the lotus feet of the Lord. The well of water in the temple complex is believed to be a part of that holy river. This well is located in front of the Ugranam or store house.

## Anjaneya Swamy Temple Legend
================================================================================

Sri Bedi Anjaneya Swamy Temple

Sri Bedi Anjaneya Swamy temple is located exactly to the opposite of Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in Tirumala.
This ancient temple enjoys priority after Sri Bhu Varaha Swamy temple and Lord Sri Venakteswara
Swamy temple. Every day, after offering naivedyam to these deities, it is brought to this temple.

According to the legend, Lord Hanuman in his youthful age wanted to leave Tirumala,
in search of a camel. This forced his mother Anjana Devi to tie his hands with
cuffs and order him to stay in that place till she returned. However,
it is believed that Anjana Devi stayed back in Akasa Ganga area and never returned to this place.
Hence, the icon of Lord Hanuman in this temple will be seen in a unique form where both his hands
were handcuffed (“Bedi-Cuffs”).

Temple Timings:
Every day from 5:30 AM to 9 PM.

Abhishekam is performed every Sunday to this deity, while special abhishekam is

## Sri Padmavathi Temple Legend (Tiruchanoor)
================================================================================

Tiruchanoor, is one of the oldest pilgrim towns located 5km away from Tirupati, is abode of Goddess Sri Padmavathi Devi, the beloved consort of Lord Venkateswara.
This pilgrim centre is popularly known as “Alarmelmangapuram” (Alar-Lotus, Mel-top, Manga-Goddess, Puram-town) or Alimelumangapuram. According to temple legend as
Goddess Mahalakshmi emerged on the golden lotus as Padmavathi Devi located at the centre of Padmasarovaram-the temple tank, this place became famous by the name
“Alarmelmangapuram”.

There is a strong belief among the pilgrims that they should pave visit to Padmavathi and seek Her divine blessings before they visit Lord Venkateswara as
Tirumala during their pilgrimage.

You can book for Seva well in advance through
ttdevasthanams.ap.gov.in

The advent of Goddess Padmavathi Devi, the consort of Lord Venkateswara, is narrated in many puranas. According to a legend,
there was once a pious Brahmin called Pundarika. Though he performed all the duties prescribed in the shastras, he did not
have a son. Finally at the age of 50, he got a son whom he named Madhava. He brought up the child carefully making him proficient
in all branches of learning and got him married to a devout lady. After some time, Madhava deviated from the righteous path and
followed another woman. After her death he wandered like a mad man. One day he followed a group of pilgrims going to Tirumala.
When he bathed in the holy Sudarshana Lake and climbed the hills his sins were washed off. There he heard a voice from the sky,
which asked him to bathe in the Swamy Pushkarini and seek the blessings of Lord Varaha Swamy. Later he was born to King Mitravarman
of Thondamandalam and was named Akasharaja.

Akasharaja grew up to be a handsome and wise prince. He married Dharanidevi. The royal couple was sad because they had no children.
On the advice of priest, Akasharaja decided to perform a yagna. When the sacrificial ground was ploughed, the couple found a lovely
girl in a thousand petal lotus. A divine voice urged the king to bring up the child with love and care. The child was named Padamavathi
as she was found in a lotus (Padma). When Padmavathi grew up, Lord Venkateshwara came in search of her. The celestial marriage of Lord
Srinivasa and Goddess Padmavathi took place on a grand note.

The temple was constructed in the time of Tondaman Chakravarthi, who happens to be the elder brother of Goddess Padmavathi.

Another popular story which is prominently heard is that of Sage Bhrigu, who hit Lord Mahavishnu on His Chest which happens
to be the residing place of His consort Goddess Maha Lakshmi. Angered with this gesture, Goddess left Vaikuntham and reached
Patalalokahere is a small story behind this temple.In Vykuntam,a maharshi called Brugu has beaten the Lord`s heart with his feet.
In return,Lord offered many services instead of getting anger. This made angry to Padmavathi and went to Patalokam, where she heard
a divine voice stating that a ‘Pushkarini’ was dug on the banks of the river ‘Swarnamukhi’. Goddess Maha Lakshmi immersed herself
in penance for 12 years. In the 13th year she emerged as Sri Padmavati from a golden lotus located at the centre of pushkarini on
the auspicious Panchami Day in the holy month of Karthika with the advent of Uttarashadha Nakshatra.

## Temples at Tiruchanoor
================================================================================

Sub-temples at Tiruchanoor Premises

This is the earliest of the shrines found inside the compound of Sri Padmavathi Ammavari Temple at Tiruchanoor.
Alagiyaperumal or Krishna swamy installed in this shrine is the presiding deity.

Historical evidences reveal that this deity and temple came to existence by 1221 AD.
A devotee by name Pokkiran spent his own money and leveled a piece of land and made
it cultivatable and he gave it to the shrine and its servants agreed to conduct
the Panguni festival for the Deity. The principal image is that of Aligiyaperumal
or Krishna Swamy seated in the centre. He sits in padmasana with his both hands in
the varada pose and resting on knees. At right side to him is another deity stated
to be Balarama, the other two images are of Krishna in Kaliya mardana pose and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy.

This shrine is found inside the compound of Sri Padmavathi Ammavari Temple at Tiruchanoor to the south of
the shrine of Alagiyaperumal or Krishna Swamy temple. This shrine came into existence sometime in the 16th century.
Inside the sanctum in the centre is the idol of Sri Varadaraja Swamy flanked by Sridevi and Bhudevi on His either side.
The Annual Avatharotsavams of this shrine will be held every year in the month of July for three days.

The one of its kind Lord Sri Suryanarayana Swamy temple is located opposite to Padma Saraovaram-the
temple tank of Sri Padmavathi Ammavaru temple in Tiruchanoor, about 5km from Tirupati.

The presiding deity of Lord Sri Suryanarayana Swamy in this ancient temple is believed to have been installed by
none other than Lord Sri Venkateswara Himself as a token of His worship to the Sun God.

According to temple legend, after Goddess Lakshmi left Vaikuntha notwithstanding the ignominious gesture of Sage
Bhrigu who hit Lord Mahavishnu on his chest, which happens to be Her dwelling place, Lord also left Vaikuntha in
search of Her. He happened to meet Goddess Padmavathi Devi and wished to marry her for which he required lot of wealth.
For “Lakshmi Kataksham” he offered penance for twelve long years worshipping Lord Surya, the eternal power which is
responsible for birth and growth of the entire humanity and fulfillment of aspirations. Lord Surya appeared before
Lord Sri Maha Vishnu and granted His wish and hence this place is also called “Bhaskara Kshetram”.

## Divya Darshan (For Pedestrians Who Walk)
================================================================================

This seva is conducted after the second bell. This ritual was first introduced in
Srivari Temple in 1984 on the Golden Jubilee Year of TTD, when a Muslim Devotee
offered Lord Srinivasa 108 gold lotuses.

The archaka commences the puja by offering dhupa(arti stick) and dipa(lit the lamp)
to the main deity. Then he recites the divine names (108) of the Lord.

While uttering each name of the Lord, one golden lotus is offered at the holy feet
of the lord. On completion of the archana to the Mula Virat, archana is offered
to Goddesses Lakshmi and Padmavati. Later Ratha Harati is offered first, followed
by ordinary Harati. During this special service, the arjita ticket holders are seated
in the Antrala corridor i.e. between the Kulasekhara padi and Bangaru Vakili.

More...

The Sahasra Kalasa Abhishekam seva is offered to Sri Bhoga Srinivasa Murthi-the
silver replica deity of Mula Virat, the processional deities of Sri Malayappa Swamy
varu along with his two consorts, Sri Viswaksena-the chief commander of Lord. This
seva is performed to the deities after the second bell in the morning at the Bangaru
Vakili.The Bhoga Srinivas Murthy is brought outside the Golden doorway and is connected
by means of thin silk rope with the Mula Virat inside the Garbhalayam (sanctum).
One end of the rope is tied round the feet of the Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy while the
other end is placed near the Kathithasta of the Mula Virat, thus symbolically establishing
a relationship between the Main deity and the Bhoga Srinivas Murthy to achieve two
purposes. Firstly, it becomes clear that Bhoga Srinivasa is representing the Mula
Virat and secondly, it makes clear that the Pooja offered to the Bhoga Srinivasa
Murthy is nothing but the puja is assumed to have offered to the main deity.

More...

Every Thursday, after the morning pooja, the Mula Virat is divested of all ornaments,
flowers etc. The deity will be draped only in Dhoti and Uttareeyam. The Thirunaman
Kaappu and Kasturi on the forehead of the main deity are also reduced in size. This
results in the unique posture of Lord where one can witness the peculiar Netra Darshan
(where the divine eyes of the Lord can be seen) of the main deity. During other
days the wide Namam with which the Lord's forehead is adorned, covers almost half
of his eyes. But on Thursday morning we can have the full view of the benign eyes
of the main deity.

On Thursdays Thiruppavada Seva is performed as arjitha Seva in the Mantapam in front
of the Bangaru Vakili and Annakutotsavam (where heaps of tamarind rice is poured)
is performed.

More...

After the Tiruppavadai Seva, the temple observes some rituals like suddhi (cleaning
of the temple) etc., and the Moola Virat is adorned with Velvet Gown from Crown
to the Feet and then the main deity is decorated with flower garlands. This service
of the main deity being adorned exclusively with garlands is known as Poolangi Seva.
The Poolangi Seva is mentioned in the Silappadikaram, the early Tamil Classic in
756 A.D.

More...

Every Friday after Suprabhatha Seva, the regular Thomala and Archana Sevas are done
in privacy and then Srivari Abhishekam is observed. This happens to be the most
ancient Arjitha Seva that is being observed in the hill shrine of Lord Venkateswara.

The Abhishekam starts with water brought from Akasa Ganga Theertham, then with Milk,
then with Suddhodakam, Chandanam and other scented articles like powdered Pachcha
Karpooram, Saffron paste and drops of civet oil etc., which are brought earlier
in the silver vessels.

## SV Museum (Tirumala and Tirupati)
================================================================================

S.V. Museum

The Hall of Antiques was first established in 1980 in
Thousand Piller mandapam opposite to the main shrine in Tirumala
. Now the S.V. Museum is situated in a sprawling building
with an area of 1.25 lakh sq.ft opposite to Vaikuntham
Queue Complex in kaleidoscopic environ of Tirumala
surrounded by beautiful gardens and it is a rejoicing
place for visiting pilgrims. This museum is an epitome
of Traditions of Tirumala, Vaishnavism and Hindu culture.
It houses more than 6000 items of historical interest
ranging in date from very early period to the present.
The collections are spread over ten sections ranging
from archaeology to contemporary items.

Sri Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh has been a repository
of rich heritage, cherished by the kings, nobles, poets, sculptures,
dancers, musicians all gathered in Tirumala and enriched the temple lore.
It contains valuable antique materials to enable an art historian to trace
the history and development of temple art.

Different galleries in the S.V. Museum host and display its acquisitions,
donations, and offerings bequeathed from the unknown past.
Vahanams gallery presents an array of Srivari Vahanams used
during Brahmotsavams. Original copper plates of Annamayya’s
compositions enthrall the visitors. Pilgrims can have a look at the
Varahaswamy Copper inscription, a cherished treasure of Tirumala.

All the great dynasties of southern peninsula of India have paid tributes to
lord Venkateswara. Pallavas of Kanchipuram, Cholas of Tanjavur, Pandyas of Madurai,
Kings of Vijayanagara of Hampi and chieftains of local dynasties have esteemed the lord.

Sri Krishnadevaraya (16th Century AD) of Vijayanagara Empire have personally visited
Tirumala seven times and offered tens of valuable ornaments made of jewels, diamonds,
emeralds and pearls. The museum displays Dhupa-Ganta donated by Sri Krishnadeva Raya
to a priest in Tirumala. You can witness this very precious item in the museum.

The stone gallery contains more than 80 wonderful images retrieved from across the region dating from 8th century AD to 19th century AD. Most of these stone sculptures speak of history of Vaishnavism in the region. The gallery of musical instruments has collected a wide range of instruments of bygone ages.

The picture gallery in the third floor displays rare images of temple history, ornaments of the lord and some contemporary art depicting Srinivasa and Tirumala.

Armory section displays variety of ancient weapons like swords, shields, battle axes, guns etc used or possessed by the rulers in the medieval and colonial periods.

In the origin and emergence of Vaishnavism in the south, the Alwars have played a significant role and they are given utmost importance in the museum. The front porch of the museum on both sides is decorated with the stone images of Alwars.

The bronze section contains idols, nutcrackers,
utensils etc made centuries ago. Big iron bells,
gigantic pulley used to lift stones in temple building,
cauldrons decorate the spacious galleries of the museum.
The Hundi of the temple has received umpteen number of gold and silver coins
ranging from Roman empire to British era, all displayed in the museum.
Tirumala temple is well known for inscriptions superscripted on its walls.
More than one thousand inscriptions depicting the history of the temple
for 1500 years are estamped and exhibited in the outer gallery of the museum.

The guide lecturers of the museum will assist you
to visit different parts of the museum. Visiting
this museum would be a rich experience for you and your
children will be inspired to learn from this wonderful centre of heritage.
The museum also has facility of a conference hall open to the public and invitees
for deliberations on Tirumala history.

Pilgrims can recline in the meditation halls on the roof of the museum in serene atmosphere and experience bliss in the lap of the lord.

It houses a library with books in Telugu, English, Tamil, Kannada and Hindi on religion, history, heritage, temple arts and architecture. It serves the curious pilgrims and research scholars doing research on Tirumala history. Harini, the auditorium in the S.V. Museum is now planning to show interesting programs, documentaries, films on Tirumala and heritage everyday from 10 am to 6 pm.

After or before the darshan of lord Venkateswara spend some time in the S V Museum and get enlightened with the hoary past and colorful present.

Note:The museum is open EVERY DAY from 8 am to 8 pm. Entry is free and works seven days a week.

The temple is the most significant monument of Indian
art and architecture, which sums up and represents subtle
values of Indian culture. The elaborations of the temple
structures followed from establishment of image worship
and accompanying development of the rituals took time to
crystallize. From the early times, Hindu temples came into
being under the royal patronage of great emperors of South
and North. Later, the spirit was caught up by mercantile
corporations and artisan guilds, resulting in constructing a
chain of temples, great and small. Temples became very hub of
rural and urban life in all aspects. Temple was the centre
for religious, cultural, social, economic and educational
activities and thus it became repository of all that was
the best in fabric, architecture, sculpture and other arts.
S.V.Museum on Temple Art in Tirupati is the first attempt
at gathering traditions in Hindu art and architecture under
one roof and presenting it to the visitors.

Kacheri Nammalwar temple was a Ramanujakutam, in the north Mada
street of Govindaraja Swamy temple in Tirupati, where two
thousand Srivaishnavas were fed every day. This holy place
is converted into Museum of Temple Art by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in 1983.

The museum is divided into two sections A and B. Section A deals with temple architecture, from choosing a place for building a temple to ways of erecting a temple. The temple is the replica of cosmic man and the architecture, iconography, rituals and worship in a temple help us understand the limitations of human mind and see the aspects of Cosmic Consciousness, of which human being is a repository. The Nagara, Vesara and Dravida and umpteen styles in designing pillars, prakaras, steps etc are shown in this section with miniature models. The iconometry, the science and technology of measurements of icons and temple structures elaborate on the technicalities of designing an icon and temple structure.

Alaya vastu is the way a Hindu temple is planned and executed.
This museum will take you through the technicalities of building a
temple respecting all the practices accepted by agamas. Stapati is
a person who supervises the building of a temple. Takshaka and Vardhaki
are assistants to Stapati. Ornaments that decorate the icon are multitude in number.
Yet, they are depicted here. Your visit to the museum would be a memorable one.

Section B deals with Srivari Vahanams, vehicles of Vishnu, used during Brahmotsavams, wood carvings, one hundred and eight Divyakshetras or holy places for Vaishnavites, Mudras of Bharatanatya, traditional dance form of India, musical instruments, Kalamkari and other art expressions. In the rituals section, an attempt has been made to bring out the significance of ritualistic obligations known as Samskaras and comparison of Tirumala temple with Vedic altar. An interesting collection of vessels used in Agama is displayed.

The museum is located near the Govindarajaswamy temple and very close to Tirupati Railway Station. The guide lecturers and gallery attendants of the museum will be happy to guide you through the galleries.

## Hindu Dharma Prachara Parishad
================================================================================

Hindu Dharma Prachara Parishad

With an aim to spread Sri Venkateswara Bhakti cult across the country and to preserve,
propagate and promote Hindu Sanatana Dharma, TTD has set up
“Hindu Dharma Pratisthanam” in 1969 and later it was named as “Dharma Prachara Parishad”.
This was rejuvenated as Hindu Dharma Prachara Parishad (HDPP) in 2007.

The agenda of the HDPP is to promote, propagate and preserve Hindu Sanatana Dharma as
the official dharmic face of TTD by organising spiritual discourses, dharmic
and devotional programmes.

As a part of its religious activities, HDPP produced
audio cassettes of the Nalayira Divya Prabandha Pasurams through
Sri Venkateswara (SV) Veda Recording Project and promoted the prabhandam and
pasurams as the basic tenets of Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple Sampradayam.
HDPP conducted various religious programs to bring the Lord closer to his devotees and also to enhance and enrich the spiritual and devotional quotient in TTD activities.

Activities conducted by Hindu Dharma Prachara Parishad are as follows:

HDPP launched a unique program of performing the celestial wedding of the replicas of
processional deities in all the rural and urban areas across the states of Andhra Pradesh and
Telangana and also the country. This program has gained immense popularity as the devotees are
provided with an opportunity to witness the celestial wedding of the Lord at their home towns.
Emboldened by the response, TTD launched an exclusive Kalyanotsavam project to perform these celestial
weddings across the country and abroad.

To enlighten the masses, especially the youth, about our ancient traditions and
values that are enshrined in the temples - the epicentres of our rich heritage and culture,
HDPP designed a unique programme –Managudi, a mass temple festival with public participation
across thousands of temples in the State. It is performed twice a year in the auspicious months
of “Shravana” and “Kartheeka” with an aim to bring people back to the temples by highlighting the
culture of the temples.

Under this programme the students of Class X, Inter I and II years are trained
on various moral subjects for a week during their summer vacation.
This programme aims at inculcating moral values to the students and make them responsible
future citizens of the country.

Nada Neerajanam is a unique platform in which an open air theatre is set
up near the Srivari temple at Tirumala to showcase the great Indian heritage,
especially its bhakti tradition in the form of dance and music.

It is a cultural phenomenon and a platform that has served
as a host to many classical music and dance programmes. A 90-minute programme is being
staged every day without a break since August 15, 2009 featuring leading Indian artistes.
This platform has also created a record of sorts in the world. Budding artists and also
veterans are given an opportunity to serve Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy by presenting a performance
(music or dance) at the platform. Nada Neeranjanam shows are also aired live by Sri Venkateswara
Bhakti Channel (SVBC) regularly.
